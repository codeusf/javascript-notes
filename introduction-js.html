    <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
      which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an
      interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
      interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was
      introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the
      Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other
      graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web
      applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time.
      The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity
      and simplicity.

    <p>
      Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language.
      The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining
      popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as
      CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
